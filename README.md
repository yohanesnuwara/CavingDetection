# Real-time Detection of Cavings in Shale Shaker

Some experiments I did when I worked in PRORES AS - not part of company project.

In this project, I implement paper by [Skea, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674775517304006?via%3Dihub) that classified borehole failure mode based on cavings shape. I developed a real-time segmentation using YOLOv11 on a shaker video, calculated the shape of cavings, and produced real-time plot. The 10-second video is publicly accessed from YouTube. 

Here is the result of the detection:

And here is the failure plot animation:
